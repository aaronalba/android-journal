# Journal
A Journal application for writing ideas, thoughts and feelings. 

## How to install?
Download the apk file in the demo directory named `journal.apk` and install it on your device.

## Features
* Add, edit and delete journal entries.
* Requires the user to create a PIN to avoid unauthorized access to the journal entries.  
* Uses SQLite for persistent storage of the journal entries in the device locally. I have not yet implemented encryption on the SQLite database file.
